# 🛡 AI Military Intelligence Dashboard

An AI-powered Military Intelligence Dashboard developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Machine Learning** to analyze historical terrorism data from the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, attack prediction, threat assessment, forecasting, and AI-generated intelligence reports.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as an academic/internship project to demonstrate how Machine Learning and Data Analytics can be used for intelligence analysis and decision support.

The dashboard allows users to:

- Analyze historical terrorism incidents
- Explore country-wise attack statistics
- Predict probable attack types using Machine Learning
- Forecast future attack trends
- Generate AI-assisted intelligence reports
- Explore and visualize GTD data interactively
